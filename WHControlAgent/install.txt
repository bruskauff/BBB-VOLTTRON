#Instructions for installing the WH Control Agent into VOLTTRON

#Make sure that when VOLTTRON is activated PyBBIO is installed. It may show up 
#while volttron is not active but I needed to reinstall it while volttron was 
#active

#Copy the entire WHControlAgent folder into volttron/Agents

#Copy and paste the code below into the lx command line of the BeagleBone Black 
#(BBB).
#This assumes the BBB was just turned on.

cd volttron
. env/bin/activate
volttron -l volttron.log -vv&
volttron-pkg package Agents/WHControlAgent
volttron-pkg configure /tmp/volttron_wheels/WHcontrolagent-0.1-py2-none-any.whl Agents/WHControlAgent/WHcontrolagent.config
volttron-ctl install /tmp/volttron_wheels/WHcontrolagent-0.1-py2-none-any.whl

#Check the status of the install with
volttron-ctl status
