#Instructions for installing the HPWH Control Agent into VOLTTRON

#Make sure that when VOLTTRON is activated PyBBIO is installed. It may show up 
#while volttron is not active but I needed to reinstall it while volttron was 
#active

#Copy the entire HPWHControlAgent folder into volttron/Agents

#Copy and paste the code below into the lx command line of the BeagleBone Black 
#(BBB).
#This assumes the BBB was just turned on.
